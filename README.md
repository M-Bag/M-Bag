- Hi, I’m M-Bag.
- I'm very new to all this stuff. Not computers so much, as I've been tinkering with them for a long time, but I am new to SBC's, Linux, and commandline anything...
- That's not entirely accurate either, I did start on DOS 3, and I used to know how to write *.bat files to do things, but it's been a long time since those days, and I've forgotten most of it.
 
-  I’m currently learning Linux and Python. 
  
-  Fun fact: I'm a musician, and I love it. YouTube.com/ComatoseMN I do a lot of crazy music related stuff there. Go check it out!!
